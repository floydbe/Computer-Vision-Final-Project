Several tools have been developed to aid a user in creating a GIF from a video. Popular options include makeagif.com, memecenter.com, and Jiffy (a Google Chrome extension to Youtube).
Each of these tools has its benefits and drawbacks. However, all of them require manual selection of start and end frames of the video segment that will be used to create a GIF. 

There has been some work in the field of automated loop detection: Loop Findr, a project of Collin Burger at Carnegie Mellon, is designed to scan movies and extract any perfectly looping segments within them. However, this tool has no methods to alter the frames of a video. While Loop Findr is able to tackle very large videos, that is the extent of its functionality.
