After the invention of the GIF file format in 1987 and their popularization in social media, the task of selecting interesting segments from videos has become important. Similarly, tools that assist users in accomplishing this task have become highly valued. While there are many conceptions of what makes an \textit{interesting}, the looping GIF has become incredibly popular. There exist several tools to help users create GIFs from videos, but the task of finding the perfect start and end frame to create a seamless loop must be done by hand. While this approach allows creativity, it is difficult and offers no guarantees that the best frames will be selected. Driven by this need for a better method of selecting proper frame pairs for perfectly looping GIF, we have created UpvoteetovpU, a tool that automatically extracts GIFs from an input video. 

In this paper, we describe UpvoteetovpU's distance metric that calculates differences between frames of a video, method for extracting perfect loops from a video based on that metric, method of creating and applying a mask to frames of a video for interesting effects and optimizations on those methods.
